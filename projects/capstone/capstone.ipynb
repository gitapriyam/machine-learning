    "1. **Scope of the work**: Identify the projects with their related projects. The donors are passionate about specific projects and if we can associate the projects with all the related projects, the donor can be presented with all the related projects. Given this information, the donor can make informed choices quickly.<br>\n",
    "2. **Solution Approach**: The similarity can be established by comparing the “project essay”: field with projects dataset. So this is essentially a document similarity problem. I plan to use Supervised Machine learning using SVM (Support Vector Machine) for document classification.\n",

Theses students are a handful at this age.  Letting them share the few computers in class is challenging, having more computers available would ensure each child has adequate time to complete lessons daily.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->This project will make a difference in the education of all of my students learning process and solve several behavior related issues due to sharing a few classroom computers.  My students need equal computer learning time! They deserve more than the public education they are enrolled in can provide.  Smaller classrooms with low student teacher ratios are reserved for private education unless you are in a Special Education environment.  We are the forgotten few because classroom computers are reserved for inclusion classes for testing.  We need computers for testing and for learning.  With computers, we can explore Mathematics in the real world without leaving the classroom.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->\"]\n"
