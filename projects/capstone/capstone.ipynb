    "This udacity project is related to kaggle competetion at https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io/home  and I use the same dataset provided for the above compettion. <br>\n",
    "1. **Scope of the work**: Identify the projects with their related projects. The donors are passionate about specific projects and if we can associate the projects with all the related projects, the donor can be presented with all the related projects. Given this information, the donor can make informed choices quickly.<br>\n",
    "2. **Solution Approach**: The similarity can be established by comparing the \"Project Short Description\", “project essay”: fields with projects dataset. So this is essentially a document similarity problem. I plan to use Supervised Machine learning using SVM (Support Vector Machine) for document classification."

The students are joining in great numbers because they want to be a part of something bigger, and they want to be inspired daily.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, with such fast growth in the music program, we are unable to keep up financially with the demand from young musicians. We need your help to give these students the education they deserve. \\n\\nWe are adventurers and we are learners.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Our music program is new, and we are working towards getting basic supplies for our students. One of these music program basics is music folders for our choir students. These music folders will keep the music organized, but will also keep it safe. Music is expensive, and we can't afford for any of it to go missing, or get ruined. Right now the kids don't have music folders and so it is difficult for them to take the music home and practice. If we could get these music folders, eventually thousands of students in my choir would benefit greatly from them as we use them for years to come.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->\n",

My students are diverse learners who have communication and learning disorders. They are lovable, energetic kids who need new technology to allow them the opportunity to communicate and learn. Some have autism, some have receptive and/or expressive language deficits, and some have articulation disorders that make them hard to understand.  Despite the many challenges they face, I am looking to keep things simple and provide my students with creative and meaningful learning experiences.  \\n\\n My students thrive on using apps that are interactive for them to learn on.  While we have gotten a couple of new iPads, we need more so every child is able to have their own iPad to differentiate their learning experiences while at school. &lt;!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER--&gt;I work hard to make our time engaging and fun while at the same time working on improving instruction and communication skills. We have a first generation iPads that no longer supports apps and is completely obsolete. The iPads will not run any of my apps that I have researched to use with my students. My students respond to technology and the students use these iPads during the time that they are working on their learning plan. These are times of free choice to decide on what they are going to learn and one out of four opportunities a day they try to use the iPads to engage in apps that teach them literacy and math skills while I work independently with other students. Using the iPad makes learning feel less like schoolwork and more fun while still helping them work towards mastering our skills we need to learn in Kindergarten. I plan on using apps specifically targeting literacy (reading) and math along with other educational standards they need to learn. The iPad case will help to ensure that all students of various ages and disabilities are able to enjoy the iPad without breaking if accidentally dropped.  Some of the students need to use the iPads during transitions so they are engaged in an activity while walking down the halls.  The case will help protect the iPad during in mishaps.&lt;!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER--&gt;</td>\n",

This model is a structured approach to teach students with Autism. Part of the structured teaching is having the students follow a daily individual schedule. This schedule helps keep them focused, engaged and on task.\\n\\nMy students are truly amazing superheroes! My students are functioning well below their grade level, and they need a variety of experiences to help prepare them for what lies ahead. They come to school ready to be the superhero students! They are all working towards being independent in different skills, and love opportunities to work on creating things with LEGOs that will enhance their learning. Since they are at a critical age I want to increase their skills to help them with advancing these skills. I teach on a campus that houses grades K-6. On this campus, there are a total of for classroom for students with Autism.&lt;!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER--&gt;As my students get older they need to learn the skills to be social in their community and on the playground. Since this is a skill that is important they could use LEGO Education as a building block to work on the community life skills they need. With the LEGO kits they can build their own community using their imagination. Once they build their communities, then they can use their imagination to roll-play how to socialize in the community and on the playground.  This will help them learn how to be creative in not only engineering buildings, but it will help them focus on ways they can make friends and activities they can participate in around the community.  With the LEGO Education kit, it will help get their creative juices flowing and teach them how to function independently around the community.\\n\\nBy Incorporating both engineering, life skills and writing, the students will learn how to grow their imaginations in a way that they never saw possible.\\n\\nLEGO Education will enhance the learning of my students by giving them a way to turn their engineering projects into life-long social skills.  With the LEGO Kits they can build a community that they would like to be a part of in the future and how to be a part of the community socially.\\n&lt;!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER--&gt;</td>\n",

If that is the case, why should they all be reading the same passages and/or books? Guided reading is an instructional approach in which the teacher works with small groups with similar reading behaviors to ensure each group gets the appropriate instruction for their level. With leveled books, I will be able to meet the needs of all readers in my classroom through Guided Reading. In using this approach of reading instruction, we will focus on sight words, word work, spelling, decoding, comprehension strategies, and so much more. The best part is, the students will be reading on a level that is not too easy, not too hard, but just right!&lt;!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER--&gt;</td>\n",

       "0  As a teacher in a low-income/high poverty school district in Chicago , my students are faced with several challenges both in and out of the classroom. My students are diverse learners who have communication and learning disorders. They are lovable, energetic kids who need new technology to allow them the opportunity to communicate and learn. Some have autism, some have receptive and/or expressive language deficits, and some have articulation disorders that make them hard to understand.  Despite the many challenges they face, I am looking to keep things simple and provide my students with creative and meaningful learning experiences.  \\n\\n My students thrive on using apps that are interactive for them to learn on.  While we have gotten a couple of new iPads, we need more so every child is able to have their own iPad to differentiate their learning experiences while at school. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->I work hard to make our time engaging and fun while at the same time working on improving instruction and communication skills. We have a first generation iPads that no longer supports apps and is completely obsolete. The iPads will not run any of my apps that I have researched to use with my students. My students respond to technology and the students use these iPads during the time that they are working on their learning plan. These are times of free choice to decide on what they are going to learn and one out of four opportunities a day they try to use the iPads to engage in apps that teach them literacy and math skills while I work independently with other students. Using the iPad makes learning feel less like schoolwork and more fun while still helping them work towards mastering our skills we need to learn in Kindergarten. I plan on using apps specifically targeting literacy (reading) and math along with other educational standards they need to learn. The iPad case will help to ensure that all students of various ages and disabilities are able to enjoy the iPad without breaking if accidentally dropped.  Some of the students need to use the iPads during transitions so they are engaged in an activity while walking down the halls.  The case will help protect the iPad during in mishaps.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->                                                                           \n",
       "1  My students have chosen to be a part of a small charter school that was founded on principles of hard work, determination, and the betterment of education. \\nMy music program is only four years old, but we are growing quickly. In the last two years, our music program has tripled in size! The students are joining in great numbers because they want to be a part of something bigger, and they want to be inspired daily.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, with such fast growth in the music program, we are unable to keep up financially with the demand from young musicians. We need your help to give these students the education they deserve. \\n\\nWe are adventurers and we are learners.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Our music program is new, and we are working towards getting basic supplies for our students. One of these music program basics is music folders for our choir students. These music folders will keep the music organized, but will also keep it safe. Music is expensive, and we can't afford for any of it to go missing, or get ruined. Right now the kids don't have music folders and so it is difficult for them to take the music home and practice. If we could get these music folders, eventually thousands of students in my choir would benefit greatly from them as we use them for years to come.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "2  Many students in my school speak English as a Second Language. Also, many students in the school live below the poverty line. Still, despite all of these challenges, they come to school every day with a smile on their face, ready to try their best. It's not always easy, but they know that if they work hard and stay focused, they will succeed. In addition to working hard, students also sometimes need that extra support. Because students have different learning styles, as teachers, we want to provide them with the specific resources they need to thrive. The students in my classroom are from many different cultures and each have their own story. They are some of the kindest and most caring students I have had the pleasure of teaching. They have fully embraced the growth mindset and consistently encourage each other to persevere in daily tasks.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->These materials would help my students stay focused and work hard during the day! Students in third grade are expected to work hard for over 6 hours everyday. Often times they have lots of extra energy that they need to use during the school day. Having alternative seating options and a stand up desk would allow them to work hard while getting out some of this energy. We expect our students to stay seated while working and it is not always the best way for them to learn. Giving them options about their seating and desk will help them take ownership of their learning and remain focused during independent work time! <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

This model is a structured approach to teach students with Autism. Part of the structured teaching is having the students follow a daily individual schedule. This schedule helps keep them focused, engaged and on task.\\n\\nMy students are truly amazing superheroes! My students are functioning well below their grade level, and they need a variety of experiences to help prepare them for what lies ahead. They come to school ready to be the superhero students! They are all working towards being independent in different skills, and love opportunities to work on creating things with LEGOs that will enhance their learning. Since they are at a critical age I want to increase their skills to help them with advancing these skills. I teach on a campus that houses grades K-6. On this campus, there are a total of for classroom for students with Autism.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->As my students get older they need to learn the skills to be social in their community and on the playground. Since this is a skill that is important they could use LEGO Education as a building block to work on the community life skills they need. With the LEGO kits they can build their own community using their imagination. Once they build their communities, then they can use their imagination to roll-play how to socialize in the community and on the playground.  This will help them learn how to be creative in not only engineering buildings, but it will help them focus on ways they can make friends and activities they can participate in around the community.

       "6  I teach students in 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th grade in a functional self-contained setting. The students in my classroom are autistic and follow the TEACCH Model. This model is a structured approach to teach students with Autism. Part of the structured teaching is having the students follow a daily individual schedule. This schedule helps keep them focused, engaged and on task.\\n\\nMy students are truly amazing superheroes! My students are functioning well below their grade level, and they need a variety of experiences to help prepare them for what lies ahead. They come to school ready to be the superhero students! They are all working towards being independent in different skills, and love opportunities to work on creating things with LEGOs that will enhance their learning. Since they are at a critical age I want to increase their skills to help them with advancing these skills. I teach on a campus that houses grades K-6. On this campus, there are a total of for classroom for students with Autism.<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->As my students get older they need to learn the skills to be social in their community and on the playground. Since this is a skill that is important they could use LEGO Education as a building block to work on the community life skills they need. With the LEGO kits they can build their own community using their imagination. Once they build their communities, then they can use their imagination to roll-play how to socialize in the community and on the playground.  This will help them learn how to be creative in not only engineering buildings, but it will help them focus on ways they can make friends and activities they can participate in around the community.  With the LEGO Education kit, it will help get their creative juices flowing and teach them how to function independently around the community.\\n\\nBy Incorporating both engineering, life skills and writing, the students will learn how to grow their imaginations in a way that they never saw possible.\\n\\nLEGO Education will enhance the learning of my students by giving them a way to turn their engineering projects into life-long social skills.

       "7  A new year and a new set of eager learners. I work at a school where the majority of my students are English learners; however, they are not letting their language barrier hold them back! On my campus, many of my students are English Learners as well as migrant, transient, or homeless. My students are constantly working their hardest to not only continue to learn the academics, but to also continue to learn to speak English correctly. Just like anyone else, my students are trying to find their way in this world and to become well rounded, educated individuals; I am doing everything I can to help them stay inspired, striving for better, believing in themselves, and continuing to learn! \\n\\nI'm here to teach, and they're eager to learn. I believe learning can still be fun and definitely should be. A student that loves, appreciates, and is enjoying their learning experience, will learn the most! <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->All children learn at different paces and read on different levels, right? If that is the case, why should they all be reading the same passages and/or books? Guided reading is an instructional approach in which the teacher works with small groups with similar reading behaviors to ensure each group gets the appropriate instruction for their level. With leveled books, I will be able to meet the needs of all readers in my classroom through Guided Reading. In using this approach of reading instruction, we will focus on sight words, word work, spelling, decoding, comprehension strategies, and so much more. The best part is, the students will be reading on a level that is not too easy, not too hard, but just right!<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

The majority of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch though. Most students come to school without the basic necessities needed to learn. Art is an escape for many of the students who aren't very successful in core curriculum classes. Trying to meet the needs of a 120+ students on a daily basis requires me to think outside the box to reach their individual needs. Amongst the many students I teach, I have several students with physical and mental disabilities. Inspiring a love of art and keeping kids engaged is one of my top priorities. <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->An Apple iPad Pro, Protective case, Apple Pencil, and Lightning to VGA adapter in my classroom will allow my students to generate original 2 and 3-dimensional designs and print them on our laser-jet, color printer, or 3-D printer. Students will also be able download various applications from the app store, such as, Procreate and Adobe Photoshop. All these items will help assist the students in their creative process. New innovative technology in the classroom would allow students to experience art in a different medium. This would help bridge the gap between fine art, digital design, and the new growing STEM concepts in today's ever changing and competitive career paths.\\n\\n    Students of this generation love using technology, and they work really well with it.\\n\\nProviding students with new technology in the classroom will allow them to put their skills and interests to use in a productive and creative way.
