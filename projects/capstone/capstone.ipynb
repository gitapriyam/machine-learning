    "1. **Scope of the work**: Identify the projects with their related projects. The donors are passionate about specific projects and if we can associate the projects with all the related projects, the donor can be presented with all the related projects. Given this information, the donor can make informed choices quickly.<br>\n",
    "2. **Solution Approach**: The similarity can be established by comparing the “project essay”: field with projects dataset. So this is essentially a document similarity problem. I plan to use Supervised Machine learning using SVM (Support Vector Machine) for document classification.\n",

Theses students are a handful at this age.  Letting them share the few computers in class is challenging, having more computers available would ensure each child has adequate time to complete lessons daily.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->This project will make a difference in the education of all of my students learning process and solve several behavior related issues due to sharing a few classroom computers.  My students need equal computer learning time! They deserve more than the public education they are enrolled in can provide.  Smaller classrooms with low student teacher ratios are reserved for private education unless you are in a Special Education environment.  We are the forgotten few because classroom computers are reserved for inclusion classes for testing.  We need computers for testing and for learning.  With computers, we can explore Mathematics in the real world without leaving the classroom.  <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->\"]\n"

They are always wanting to learn more and constantly ask questions to make their learning more meaningful. They really show that they enjoy learning and that they want to continue to learn. They really enjoy school and it is a great place for them to come and feel safe and enhance their learning! <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Students are more on the go than ever! These flexible seating options in my classroom will make a huge difference for all students because it will give them a variety of ways to do their work in the classroom. Students are on the go even more these days and these flexible seating options will give students the options on how they want to complete their work. It will make them feel empowered because they have the choice.\\n\\nThese flexible seating options will also be beneficial because it gets students out of their regular desks and also provides different areas to do their work. We do reading rotations in the morning and they are constantly moving from station to station. Instead of sitting in regular chairs at the stations, these flexible seating options will be perfect and the student's will be able to choose what is more comfortable for them.\\n\\nNot only will these benefit the student's by making it more comfortable to get their work done, they just make the atmosphere of the classroom more fun! Students will be more engaged in their classroom work and will want to go to those stations even more!<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->   \n",

      "1623  My students are amazing and I couldn't have asked for a better class! They amaze me everyday with how much they are learning and they are very hard workers. They are always wanting to learn more and constantly ask questions to make their learning more meaningful. They really show that they enjoy learning and that they want to continue to learn. They really enjoy school and it is a great place for them to come and feel safe and enhance their learning! <!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->Students are more on the go then ever! These flexible seating options in my classroom will make a huge difference for all students because it will give them a variety of ways to do their work in the classroom. Students are on the go even more these days and these flexible seating options will give students the options on how they want to complete their work. It will make them feel empowered because they have the choice.\\n\\nThese flexible seating options will also be beneficial because it gets students out of their regular desks and also provides different areas to do their work. We do reading rotations in the morning and they are constantly moving from station to station. Instead of sitting in regular chairs at the stations, these flexible seating options will be perfect and the student's will be able to choose what is more comfortable for them.\\n\\nNot only will these benefit the student's by making it more comfortable to get their work done, they just make the atmosphere of the classroom more fun! Students will be more engaged in their classroom work and will want to go to those stations even more!<!--DONOTREMOVEESSAYDIVIDER-->   \n",
